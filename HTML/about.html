      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>
         Our Ganesh Group is a community formed with love, devotion, and respect for Lord Ganesha the 
            remover of obstacles and the harbinger of wisdom and prosperity. 
            The purpose of this group is not only to worship Bappa but also to create a platform where 
            people can come together, share their faith, and celebrate the divine spirit of unity.

            Every year, we organize Ganesh Utsav and various spiritual programs including Aartis, 
            Bhajans, and devotional gatherings where devotees can immerse themselves in t
            he divine energy of Lord Ganesha.Through chanting mantras and sharing sacred stories,
            we strive to spread positivity and knowledge of our cultural heritage.

            Beyond religious celebrations, our group also believes in service (Seva). 
            We engage in social and cultural activities such as helping the needy, organizing 
            educational programs, and encouraging the youth to participate in cultural values 
            and traditions. Our mission is to blend devotion with service, 
            ensuring that spirituality is not just limited to rituals, but also 
            expressed through compassion and community work.

            We welcome everyone with open hearts to join us in this journey of devotion, culture, and 
            togetherness. May Lord Ganesha bless all with wisdom, happiness, and peace.
      </p>
