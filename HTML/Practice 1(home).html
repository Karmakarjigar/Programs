    <p><h1>"The Final Message"</h1      >
In a quiet village, surrounded by hills and silence, lived a 19-year-old boy named Rayan. He was known for fixing things — broken radios, old phones, watches — anything but hearts, he would say with a sad smile.

One evening, while cleaning out his grandfather’s dusty attic, he found an old Nokia phone, dead and rusted. Curious, he replaced the battery. The screen blinked:
1 unread message.

"Don’t go to the lake on July 16th — R."

Chills ran down his spine. That was today's date. And the sender? "R."
That was his initial.

He checked the sent folder. Nothing. No drafts, no SIM card even. The phone had no way of sending anything.

Brushing it off as a glitch, he went outside. His friends were calling him to go to the lake, just like they did every year. Bonfire, fireworks, music.

But something inside him felt... off.

Still, curiosity beat caution, and he went.

As they danced around the fire, one friend lit a skyrocket near the lake's edge. It tipped sideways.

Boom.

The explosion echoed like a thunderclap. Smoke. Screams. Fire. Two of his friends were hurt. Another fell into the lake and couldn't be found for hours.

Rayan sat on the grass, trembling. He took out the old phone.

Battery: 0%. It never turned on again.</p>
